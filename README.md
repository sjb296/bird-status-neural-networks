# Bird conservation status prediction by NN

This project was the continuous assessment for my 3rd year Learning from Data module. The aim was to determine the extent to which machine learning could explain & reinforce human expert decisions on UK bird conservation status - the results showed that my particular approach did not, primarily due to a severely imbalanced dataset.

Tech used: **Python · Numpy · Pandas · Jupyter**
